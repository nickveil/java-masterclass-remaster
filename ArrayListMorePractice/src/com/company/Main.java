        // The EmployeeRoster class has the functionality listed above.
        // Add a menu of options that are available.
        // Options:  Quit, print list of employees, add new employee, update existing employee, remove employee
        // and search/find employee.
        // When adding or updating be sure to check if the employee already exists (use name)
        // Be sure not to expose the inner workings of the Arraylist to EmployeeRoster
        // e.g. no ints, no .get(i) etc
        // EmployeeRoster should do everything with Employees objects only.
